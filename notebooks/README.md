# Notebooks

- `TabNet.ipynb` and/or `telco_churn_tabnet_analysis.ipynb` â€” your analysis notebooks.
- Keep exploratory work here; move reusable code into `src/` as it stabilizes.

Tips:
- Use `data/sample/sample_100.csv` for quick iteration.
- For full experiments, place the original CSV at `data/raw/WA_Fn-UseC_-Telco-Customer-Churn.csv`.
